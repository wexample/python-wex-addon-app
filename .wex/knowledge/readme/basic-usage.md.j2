## Usage

### File State Management
* `app::file-state/rectify [--all-packages]`: Normalizes/rectifies code for a single app or across all packages in the suite; no commits.

### Version Management
* `app::package/bump [--all-packages] [--yes]`: Bumps version for a single package or all packages in the suite.
* `app::package/bump-changed [--all-packages] [--yes]`: Bumps version only for packages that have new content (no current version tag on HEAD).
* `app::suite/propagate-versions`: Propagates package versions across all dependents in the suite.

### Git Operations
* `app::suite/commit-and-push [--yes]`: Commits and pushes changes for all packages with uncommitted changes.

### Suite Execution
* `app::suite/exec-command -c <command> [--arguments "<args>"]`: Executes a manager command on all packages (e.g., `app::info/show`).
* `app::suite/exec-shell -c "<command>"`: Executes a shell command on all packages.

### Publishing
* `app::suite/prepare --yes [--all|--package X]`: Validates internal deps, propagates versions, and commits/pushes if needed.
* `app::suite/publish [--all|--package X]`: Publishes only packages that need it; adds/pushes publication tag after successful publish; never bumps here.

### Common Workflows

**Bump all changed packages and propagate:**
```bash
app::package/bump-changed --all-packages && app::suite/propagate-versions && app::suite/commit-and-push --yes
```

**Rectify all packages:**
```bash
app::file-state/rectify --all-packages
```

**Get info for all packages:**
```bash
app::suite/exec-command -c app::info/show
```
